What about a NY live music location/review based application?

Yes. Someone wants to enjoy jazz music at 8pm and he is located in Soho. So he goes to the app and he simply fills a form "genre" "price frame" "time" "neighborhood" "venue type" for example. So he has options such as Apotheke, The Blue Note, The Bitter End, Mercury Lounge etc.

we can find several websites which could feed the app such as www.myfreeconcert.com or www.boweryballroom.com
